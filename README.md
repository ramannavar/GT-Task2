# Zero-Downtime Deployment with Octopus Deploy

This solution provides a complete zero-downtime deployment process for Azure Web Apps using Octopus Deploy with a blue-green deployment strategy.

## Overview

The solution implements a blue-green deployment pattern that ensures zero service interruption during deployments by maintaining two identical production environments and switching traffic between them.

## Prerequisites

### Azure Resources
- Azure App Service Plan (Standard or Premium tier for deployment slots)
- Azure Web App with deployment slots enabled
- Azure Traffic Manager (optional, for advanced traffic routing)

### Octopus Deploy Setup
- Octopus Deploy instance (Cloud or Server)
- Azure Service Principal configured in Octopus
- Deployment targets configured for Azure Web Apps

## Required Octopus Configuration

### 1. Service Connections
Create an Azure Account in Octopus Deploy:
- **Account Type**: Azure Service Principal
- **Subscription ID**: Your Azure subscription ID
- **Client ID**: Service principal application ID
- **Client Secret**: Service principal password
- **Tenant ID**: Azure Active Directory tenant ID

### 2. Variables
Configure the following project variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Scope |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| `Azure.WebApp.Name` | `your-webapp-name` | All |
| `Azure.ResourceGroup` | `your-resource-group` | All |
| `Azure.SubscriptionId` | `your-subscription-id` | All |
| `Azure.DeploymentSlot.Blue` | `blue` | All |
| `Azure.DeploymentSlot.Green` | `green` | All |
| `Azure.CurrentSlot` | `blue` | Production |
| `Azure.TargetSlot` | `green` | Production |
| `HealthCheck.Timeout` | `300` | All |
| `HealthCheck.Interval` | `30` | All |

### 3. Environments
- **Development**: For initial testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live deployments

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Import the Deployment Process
1. In Octopus Deploy, create a new project
2. Navigate to **Process** → **Import**
3. Upload the `octopus-deployment-process.json` file
4. Review and update variable values as needed

### 2. Configure Azure Targets
1. Go to **Infrastructure** → **Deployment Targets**
2. Add Azure Web App targets for each environment
3. Ensure proper role assignments (e.g., `azure-webapp`, `production`)

### 3. Configure Lifecycle
1. Create a lifecycle that includes your environments
2. Set appropriate phase requirements (automatic vs manual promotions)

### 4. Test Deployment
1. Create a release with a test package
2. Deploy to Development first
3. Validate the blue-green switching mechanism
4. Deploy to Production

## Deployment Process Flow

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**: Validate Azure connectivity and slot availability
2. **Deploy to Target Slot**: Deploy application to the inactive slot (blue or green)
3. **Health Checks**: Verify application health in the target slot
4. **Slot Swap**: Switch traffic from current slot to target slot
5. **Post-deployment Validation**: Confirm successful deployment
6. **Cleanup**: Update variables for next deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Slot swap fails**: Check that both slots are in healthy state
- **Health checks timeout**: Verify application startup time and health endpoints
- **Permission errors**: Ensure service principal has proper Azure permissions

### Required Azure Permissions
The service principal needs the following permissions:
- **Contributor** role on the Resource Group
- **Web Plan Contributor** role for slot operations

## Monitoring

The deployment process includes:
- Health check validation before slot swap
- Automated rollback on failure
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check Octopus Deploy logs
2. Verify Azure resource health
3. Review deployment process variables
4. Contact your DevOps team
