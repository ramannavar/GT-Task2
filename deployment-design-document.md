# Zero-Downtime Deployment Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a zero-downtime deployment solution for Azure Web Apps using Octopus Deploy. The solution leverages a blue-green deployment strategy with Azure App Service deployment slots to ensure continuous service availability during application updates.

## Deployment Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment

### Overview
Blue-green deployment maintains two identical production environments (blue and green slots) where only one serves live traffic at any time. During deployment, the new version is deployed to the inactive slot, validated, and then traffic is switched instantly.

### Benefits
- **Zero Downtime**: Instant traffic switching eliminates service interruption
- **Quick Rollback**: Immediate rollback capability if issues are detected
- **Safe Testing**: New version can be thoroughly tested before going live
- **Risk Mitigation**: Issues are caught in the staging slot before affecting users

### Implementation with Azure App Service
Azure App Service deployment slots provide native support for blue-green deployments:
- **Production Slot**: Currently serving live traffic
- **Staging Slot**: Receives new deployment and testing
- **Slot Swap**: Atomic operation that switches traffic between slots

## Octopus Deploy Process Overview

### Process Steps Summary

1. **Variable Resolution & Validation**
   - Determine current active slot (blue/green)
   - Set target slot for deployment
   - Validate Azure connectivity and permissions

2. **Pre-deployment Health Check**
   - Verify current production slot health
   - Ensure target slot is available
   - Check Azure resources status

3. **Application Deployment**
   - Deploy application package to target slot
   - Apply configuration transformations
   - Install/update dependencies

4. **Warm-up & Validation**
   - Start application in target slot
   - Execute health check endpoints
   - Validate application functionality
   - Performance baseline verification

5. **Traffic Switch (Slot Swap)**
   - Perform Azure slot swap operation
   - Monitor swap completion
   - Verify traffic routing

6. **Post-deployment Validation**
   - Health checks on new production slot
   - Functional testing
   - Performance monitoring

7. **Variable Update & Cleanup**
   - Update slot variables for next deployment
   - Archive deployment artifacts
   - Generate deployment report

### Step Details

#### Step 1: Determine Target Slot
```powershell
# Logic to determine which slot to deploy to
if ($OctopusParameters["Azure.CurrentSlot"] -eq "blue") {
    Set-OctopusVariable -name "Azure.TargetSlot" -value "green"
} else {
    Set-OctopusVariable -name "Azure.TargetSlot" -value "blue"
}
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Target Slot
- **Step Type**: Deploy an Azure App Service
- **Target**: Deployment slot specified by `Azure.TargetSlot` variable
- **Package**: Application deployment package
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings

#### Step 3: Health Check Validation
- **Step Type**: Health Check
- **Target**: Target slot URL
- **Endpoints**: `/health`, `/api/status`
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes with 30-second intervals

#### Step 4: Slot Swap Operation
- **Step Type**: Run Azure PowerShell Script
- **Operation**: Swap deployment slots
- **Validation**: Verify swap completion

#### Step 5: Post-Swap Validation
- **Step Type**: Health Check
- **Target**: Production slot (new deployment)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive health verification

## Key Variables and Configurations

### Project Variables

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `Azure.WebApp.Name` | Target web application name | `myapp-prod` |
| `Azure.ResourceGroup` | Azure resource group | `rg-myapp-prod` |
| `Azure.CurrentSlot` | Currently active slot | `blue` |
| `Azure.TargetSlot` | Deployment target slot | `green` |
| `HealthCheck.Timeout` | Health check timeout (seconds) | `300` |
| `HealthCheck.RetryInterval` | Retry interval (seconds) | `30` |
| `Deployment.WarmupTime` | Application warmup duration | `120` |

### Environment-Specific Variables

Variables are scoped by environment to support different configurations:
- **Development**: Simplified validation, faster timeouts
- **Staging**: Full validation suite, production-like settings
- **Production**: Maximum validation, extended timeouts

## Zero-Downtime Assurance

### Traffic Management
1. **Atomic Swap**: Azure slot swap is an atomic operation
2. **Connection Draining**: Existing connections complete naturally
3. **Instant Routing**: New requests immediately route to new slot

### Failure Handling
1. **Health Check Failures**: Deployment stops before slot swap
2. **Swap Failures**: Automatic rollback to previous slot
3. **Post-Swap Issues**: Manual rollback capability within minutes

### Monitoring and Validation
1. **Continuous Health Monitoring**: Before, during, and after deployment
2. **Automated Testing**: Functional and performance validation
3. **Alerting**: Real-time notifications for any issues

### Performance Considerations
1. **Warm-up Period**: Applications are fully initialized before receiving traffic
2. **Connection Pooling**: Database connections established before swap
3. **Cache Warming**: Application caches populated during validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Deployment Risks
- **Configuration Errors**: Caught during target slot validation
- **Code Defects**: Identified through comprehensive testing
- **Performance Issues**: Detected during warm-up phase

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Swap back to previous slot (< 2 minutes)
2. **Database Rollback**: If required, separate database migration strategy
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for 30 minutes post-deployment

## Conclusion

This blue-green deployment strategy with Octopus Deploy provides:
- **True Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during deployments
- **High Reliability**: Multiple validation points and instant rollback
- **Operational Excellence**: Automated process with comprehensive monitoring
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to multiple environments and applications

The solution balances deployment speed with safety, ensuring reliable delivery of application updates without impacting end users.
